- Transaction trends for categories and customers
	- Between the transactions for sku categories and customers, there have been overlapping time periods where they both have high amount of transactions. This suggests that transactions are driven by seasonal factors.
	- This analysis evaluated transaction patterns across product categories and customer activity. However, because the dataset covers only a single year, the observed patterns reflect within-year behavior specific to 2016. Additional years of data would be required to validate these findings and support broader annual transaction analysis or predictive modeling.
